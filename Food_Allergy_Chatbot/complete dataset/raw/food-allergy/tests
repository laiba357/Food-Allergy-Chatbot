a skin-prick test (where a drop of liquid containing a food you may be allergic to is put on your skin to see if it reacts)
blood tests
a special diet where you avoid eating the food you might be allergic to, to see if your symptoms get better
You may also be asked to keep a food and symptoms diary to help work out what may be triggering your symptoms.

Your symptoms. Give your care team a detailed history of your or your child's symptoms â€” which foods, and how much, seem to cause problems.
Your family history of allergies. Also share information about members of your family who have allergies of any kind.
A physical examination. A careful exam can often identify or exclude other medical problems.

A skin test. A skin prick test can determine your reaction to a particular food. In this test, a small amount of the suspected food is placed on the skin of your forearm or back. A doctor or another healthcare professional then pricks your skin with a needle to allow a tiny amount of the substance beneath your skin surface.

If you're allergic to a particular substance being tested, you develop a raised bump or reaction. However, a positive reaction to this test alone isn't enough to confirm a food allergy.

A blood test. A blood test can measure your immune system's response to particular foods by measuring the allergy-related antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE).

For this test, a blood sample taken in your care professional's office is sent to a medical laboratory. It will then be tested for different foods.

Elimination diet. You may be asked to eliminate suspect foods for a week or two and then add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to specific foods. However, elimination diets aren't foolproof.

An elimination diet can't tell you whether your reaction to a food is a true allergy instead of a food sensitivity. Also, if you've had a severe reaction to a food in the past, an elimination diet may not be safe.
Oral food challenge. During this test, done in a healthcare professional's office, you'll be given small but increasing amounts of the food suspected of causing your symptoms. If you don't have a reaction during this test, you may be able to include this food in your diet again.
